**A modern game server management panel, rebuilt from the ground up in Rust.**

</div>

Calagopus is a ground-up reimplementation of [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel) in Rust. It keeps what made the original great - secure, container-based game server management - while aiming for better performance, a refreshed UI, more features, and a cleaner extension model on both the frontend and backend. If you already run Pterodactyl or Pelican, there is a supported migration path.

## Features

- **Rust backend** - a fast, efficient backend built on Tokio and Axum.
- **Modern frontend** - React, Mantine, and Tailwind for a clean, responsive UI.
- **Extensible by design** - first-class extension systems for backend and frontend, no hacky patches or overrides, real plugin APIs.
- **Egg compatible** - reuses Pterodactyl-style eggs, including a Rust port of Laravel's validation rules.
- **Migration friendly** - import your existing setup from [Pterodactyl](https://calagopus.com/docs/advanced/migrating/pterodactyl) or [Pelican](https://calagopus.com/docs/advanced/migrating/pelican).
